# RunWhen CodeCollection Devtools

[![Tests](https://github.com/runwhen-contrib/codecollection-devtools/actions/workflows/smoke-test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/runwhen-contrib/codecollection-devtools/actions/workflows/smoke-test.yaml)

[![Build](https://github.com/runwhen-contrib/codecollection-devtools/actions/workflows/build-push.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/runwhen-contrib/codecollection-devtools/actions/workflows/build-push.yaml)

This repository is for managing developer tooling related to creating your own CodeCollections. You can use it to do development directly from source, in a devcontainer from source, or from the image. CodeCollections can also use this image as a base for their dev images. Check the [docs](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-authors/getting-started-with-codecollection-development) for more information.

Looking to be a contributor for CodeCollections or start your own? We'd love to collaborate! Head on over to our [public docs](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-authors/getting-started-with-codecollection-development) to get started.
