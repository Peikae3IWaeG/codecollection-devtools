This repository is for managing developer tooling related to creating your own CodeCollections. You can use it to do development directly from source, in a devcontainer from source, or from the image. CodeCollections can also use this image as a base for their dev images. Check the [docs](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-authors/getting-started-with-codecollection-development) for more information.

Looking to be a contributor for CodeCollections or start your own? We'd love to collaborate! Head on over to our [public docs](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-authors/getting-started-with-codecollection-development) to get started.
